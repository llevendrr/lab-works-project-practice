# Lab works for the "Project Practice" discipline

This repository contains practical lab assignments designed to develop skills in planning, implementing, and delivering software projects. Each lab focuses on applied techniques used throughout the project lifecycle: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and retrospective.

## Learning objectives
- Practice project planning, task breakdown, and time estimation.
- Apply software design and implementation patterns in small teams.
- Use version control, CI/CD, and automated testing in a reproducible workflow.
- Improve collaboration, code review, and documentation skills.


Use the lab folders for individual assignments and follow the README in each folder for specific instructions.
